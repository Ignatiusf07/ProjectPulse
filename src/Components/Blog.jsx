        <h1>Agile Project Management Tool</h1>
        <p>
            In today's fast-paced world, traditional project management methods often fall short. That's where agile project management comes in. Agile is an iterative approach that breaks down large projects into smaller, more manageable steps, allowing teams to adapt to changes quickly, collaborate effectively, and deliver value to customers continuously. But to truly harness the power of agile, you need the right tools.

            <h2>What Is an Agile Project Management Tool?</h2>
            <p>An agile project management tool is a software solution designed to support agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban. While a physical whiteboard and sticky notes can work for a small, co-located team, digital tools provide essential features for modern, often distributed teams. They serve as a centralized hub for all project-related activities, ensuring everyone is on the same page.</p>
            <h3>These tools offer features that are critical for agile workflows, including:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Backlog Management: A centralized, prioritized list of all the work that needs to be done.</li>
                <li>Sprint Planning: The ability to plan and manage short, fixed-length iterations of work , sprints by pulling tasks from the backlog.</li>
                <li>Task Boards: Visual boards (like Kanban boards) that show the status of each task, typically with columns like "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."</li>
                <li>Collaboration Features: Real-time communication, file sharing, and commenting to foster teamwork.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
